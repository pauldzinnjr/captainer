# üß† IT Mentor ‚Äì FOSS Edition (v0.4.0)

This is version **v0.4.0** and is **not yet user-tested**.

---

**Captainer** is designed to be a reusable system prompt that you can even use on your iPhone with Terminus and Tailscale (a great way to manage your server on the go üòâ). The original reason for this script is to leverage LLMs to manage servers, helping you learn server hosting best practices and benefit from a professionally built network.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install** the discovery script on each remote host (Linux/macOS/Windows).
2. **Run** the script (`captainer-discover.sh` or `captainer-discover.ps1`) to generate context.
3. **Copy** the contents of `captainer-core-prompt.md` into your LLM session.
4. **Paste** into the chat:
   - **Local Terminal Context** (e.g., ‚ÄúiPhone using Terminus via Tailscale SSH‚Äù)
   - **Host Info** (output from discovery script)
   - **Task / Goal** (e.g., ‚ÄúInstall Nextcloud on my Proxmox VM‚Äù)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Linux / macOS

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/captainer
sudo curl -fsSL https://YOUR_REPO_URL/captainer-discover.sh \
  -o /opt/captainer/captainer-discover.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/captainer/captainer-discover.sh
sudo ln -sf /opt/captainer/captainer-discover.sh /usr/local/bin/captainer-discover

# Generate context
captainer-discover
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
New-Item -Path 'C:\ProgramData\captainer' -ItemType Directory -Force
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://YOUR_REPO_URL/captainer-discover.ps1' `
  -OutFile 'C:\ProgramData\captainer\captainer-discover.ps1'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Generate context
& 'C:\ProgramData\captainer\captainer-discover.ps1'

- `$env:USERPROFILE\captainer-context.txt` (Windows)

Paste the contents of that file into your chat window along with your local context and goal.
